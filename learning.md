# Learning Hansom

A guided tour through event-driven architecture, using Hansom as the working example. Each section asks a question, answers it briefly, and shows the smallest piece of Hansom code that proves it. Read top-to-bottom, or jump by topic.

If you want a *product* overview — what Hansom is, what's done, what's next — see the [README](README.md).

Open an answer only after you have a guess. If you can explain it to a rubber duck without opening the answer, you have the idea. If you already know **MediatR**, **clean architecture**, and **DDD**, several questions are a translation into this codebase. Frontend stack is out of scope here.

## The basics

<details>
<summary>What is a message in this project, versus a method call?</summary>

A message is a piece of data (a `record` such as `PlaceOrder`) that *might* be handled later, on another thread, after a retry, or after a process restart. Hansom wraps that body in `Message` (`src/Hansom/Domain/Messaging/ValueObjects/Message.cs`): the CLR object, not JSON.

A method call is "run this now, on my stack, throw if it fails." If `OrderSaga.Start` called `ChargePaymentHandler.Handle(...)` directly, you would skip the queue, the retry policy, the inbox, and the chance to load saga state again. Event-driven code decides *what happened* (or what should happen next) and emits a message. It does not reach into the next step.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is an Envelope, and why isn't the record enough?</summary>

Your `record` is the body. Hansom's unit of work is `Envelope`: body plus `EnvelopeId`, `MessageType`, `Destination`, correlation / conversation / saga ids, `SentAt`, `DeliverBy`, `Headers`, `ContentType`, `Attempts`, and `EnvelopeData` (bytes, empty until Serialization).

Retries will reuse the **same** envelope (`Attempts` 1, then 2, then 3). They are not three new publishes. Conversation ids are why a future `TrackActivity` can wait for `PlaceOrder` + `ChargePayment` + `PaymentCharged` as one conversation. The inbox stores envelopes, not bare records, so a restart can continue the same attempt count.

See `src/Hansom/Domain/Envelope/Envelope.cs`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why do Message, MessageType, and SagaId live outside Envelope?</summary>

Envelope **carries** them. Messaging **defines** the wire name. Sagas **defines** instance identity.

If `MessageType` lived only on Envelope, Messaging would import Envelope for its own core idea (`MessageTypeNaming` returns a name). The wrapper would own the contract. After the move, Envelope depends on Messaging and Sagas. Messaging does not depend on Envelope.

`Message` is the CLR body slot. `MessageType` is the stable string on the wire. `SagaId` is which process-manager instance this envelope belongs to (empty if none). Destination, attempts, and bytes stay on Envelope: those are how *this copy* is sent, retried, and stored.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What does MessageTypeNaming do that the catalog does not?</summary>

`MessageTypeNaming.For(Type)` is a pure function: `[MessageIdentity]` alias if present, otherwise `FullName` (not `Name`, not `AssemblyQualifiedName`). It always has a `Type`, so this direction does not fail.

`MessageTypeCatalog` is the map Discovery fills. `Register` records every `(Type, MessageType)` pair (collisions stay on the list for the validator). `_byType` is outbound `GetName`. `_byName` is inbound `Lookup`. Two processes that register the same CLR type must agree on the string.

A dictionary cannot hold two types with the same name. That is why the list is the source of truth.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is an unknown wire name a lookup result, not an exception?</summary>

A Rabbit payload or inbox row has a string, not a `Type`. `Lookup` returns `KnownMessageType` or `UnknownMessageType`. SerializationPlan: unknown CLR type is a handled failure handed to Execution / `IMissingHandler`, not a crash in the serializer.

`MessageTypeValidator` only says "not empty, not whitespace." "We have never registered this name" is Messaging's job, and it is allowed to fail in a typed way.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why FullName, not Name or AssemblyQualifiedName?</summary>

`Name` alone (`PlaceOrder`) collides across namespaces. `AssemblyQualifiedName` includes the assembly version; bumping a package would change the wire name and break every stored envelope and every other process.

`FullName` is stable across versions. `[MessageIdentity("place-order")]` is the override when you rename the class but must keep the contract.

</details>

## The bus

<details>
<summary>Invoke vs Publish — what is the difference?</summary>

Both end up in Execution (envelope, handler, error policy, cascades). They differ in **when the caller continues**.

**`InvokeAsync`** is a function call through the bus. `await` does not finish until that handler returns. Retry-now / retry-with-cooldown happen inside that await. There is no queue in front of the caller. Use Invoke when the current request cannot continue until *this* handler has finished.

**`PublishAsync`** is "accept this envelope and let go." Routing runs, the message lands on a local queue, and the caller is done.

Rule of thumb: **Invoke = I need this handler done before I continue. Publish = I need this work to happen, not necessarily here or now.**

`IMessageBus` does not own threads or sockets. `Mediator` (Invoke) and `LocalQueues` (Publish) implement the difference. See `src/Hansom/Application/Bus/IMessageBus.cs` and `Application/Mediator/Mediator.cs`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How does this compare to MediatR?</summary>

**`InvokeAsync` is MediatR's `Send`.** One message in, handler runs now, caller waits. Hansom finds `Handle(PlaceOrder)` by convention (`Application/Discovery/HandlerConvention`) instead of `IRequestHandler<PlaceOrder>`.

**`PublishAsync` is not MediatR.** The work can retry, land on another thread, or survive a restart. MediatR `INotification` is still not a queue, an outbox, or a saga.

The trap is to `InvokeAsync` the next step from inside a handler (`IMediator.Send` the next command). That keeps you on one stack, with stale saga state, and no outbox. Return `ChargePayment` and let the bus load `OrderSaga` again.

| You know | In Hansom |
| --- | --- |
| `IMediator.Send` / `IRequestHandler<T>` | `InvokeAsync` |
| `IMediator.Publish` / `INotification` | still in-process; not a durable queue |
| "controller calls the next handler" | cascade a message instead |
| One handler, one HTTP request | `PlaceOrder` starts a conversation that outlives the call |

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do handlers get discovered?</summary>

`HandlerConvention` (`src/Hansom/Application/Discovery/HandlerConvention.cs`) walks the assemblies you opt into via `HansomOptions.HandlerAssemblies`. It looks for methods named `Handle`, `HandleAsync`, `Start`, or `Consume` on a class and registers each as a candidate handler for the message type the parameter declares. The catalog (`HandlerCatalog`) is a `Type → handlers[]` map the runtime hits on every envelope.

This is reflection at startup, not on the hot path. Perf #1 cached the invoker so the per-call cost is one delegate dispatch.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why do cascading messages wait for the handler to succeed?</summary>

A cascade is a return value the bus publishes **after** the current handler succeeds. `OrderSaga.Start` returns `(saga, OrderTimeout, ChargePayment)`. That is not a call to the payment handler.

If the handler throws, nothing is emitted. That is the in-memory **outbox** (`Application/Cascades`). Durable outbox is the same rule persisted (`Infrastructure/Persistence`). Do not `InvokeAsync` the next saga step from inside a saga handler.

Prove-with: a throwing handler publishes nothing; a succeeding handler publishes exactly its return values, after it returns. See `CascadingMessages` and `ICascadePublisher`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a local queue? Why named payments?</summary>

With no RabbitMQ, the bus still has queues: in-process workers. Routing (`Application/Routing`) maps `ChargePayment` → `local://payments/`. LocalQueues (`Infrastructure/LocalQueues`) obey that destination. A worker runs the handler off the caller's thread.

Routing is a table of rules, not a switch inside each handler. The TPL Dataflow block is Infrastructure. `ChargePayment` gets `local://payments/` without the saga naming a queue in `Start`. The attribute is `[LocalQueue("name")]` on the message, or a registration in `RoutingCatalog`.

</details>

## Failure and recovery

<details>
<summary>Why configure retry on the handler instead of a for-loop?</summary>

Execution (`Application/Execution/Executor.cs`) wraps one handler call: attempts, retry / retry-with-cooldown / requeue / dead-letter, by exception type and/or message type. `InvokeAsync` only applies retry and retry-with-cooldown (match Wolverine).

A `for` loop inside the handler would block one worker, mix "call the gateway" with "how we recover," and skip dead-letter as a first-class outcome. The policy lives on the chain so every `ChargePayment` gets the same recovery, including inbox recovery after a restart.

The same `Envelope` comes back with `Attempts` 1, 2, 3; then error-queue if the policy says so. See `ErrorPolicyCatalog` in `src/Hansom/Application/Execution/`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a dead-letter?</summary>

A dead-letter is the final resting place for a message whose handler has failed permanently. The executor publishes to `IErrorQueue` on exhausted retries. The error queue writes to `IDeadLetterStore` (an inbox/outbox port), so the row can be inspected, replayed, or discarded.

In-memory today (`Infrastructure/Persistence/DeadLetterQueueAdapter.cs`); durable in the PostgreSQL adapter. Ports in `src/Hansom/Application/Persistence/`.

</details>

## Time and state

<details>
<summary>What does the OrderSaga conversation look like end to end?</summary>

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Program
    participant Saga as OrderSaga
    participant Store as saga store
    participant Payments as payments queue
    participant Clock as scheduled timeout

    Program->>Saga: Publish PlaceOrder
    Saga->>Store: commit saga and ChargePayment envelope
    Saga-->>Payments: cascade ChargePayment
    Saga-->>Clock: cascade OrderTimeout at T plus 1m
    Payments->>Payments: fail, retry, succeed
    Payments->>Saga: cascade PaymentCharged
    Saga->>Store: MarkCompleted
    Clock->>Saga: OrderTimeout later
    Saga->>Saga: NotFound already done
```

Read top-to-bottom: `PlaceOrder` starts the saga, the saga cascades the charge and the timeout, the charge retries until it succeeds, the saga marks complete, the late timeout arrives and the saga's `NotFound` swallows it. The `OrderTimeout` is *not* cancelled when the saga completes — EDA assumes messages arrive late, twice, or after the process is over.

Sample code in `samples/Helpdesk/src/Helpdesk.Application/OrderSaga.cs`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is timeout an attribute, not TimeoutMessage or Task.Delay?</summary>

Wolverine uses `OrderTimeout : TimeoutMessage(1.Minutes())`. Attribute arguments cannot be `TimeSpan`, so Hansom uses `[Timeout(Minutes = 1)]` on the message type: integers, then `Delay` as `TimeSpan`.

The saga class is inert state (`MarkCompleted` / `IsCompleted`). It does not run a timer. Scheduling sets `Envelope.DeliverBy` from `SentAt + Delay` and parks the envelope until `IMessageScheduler.PlayDue(asOf)`. Tests call `PlayDue` to fast-forward without `Task.Delay`.

`await Task.Delay(1.Minute())` inside `Start` would block a worker, die with the process, and be painful to test.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a saga doing that a chain of cascades does not?</summary>

Cascades are "after this handler succeeds, emit these messages." There is no state sitting around between them except whatever you put in the message bodies.

A **saga** is state that lives across several messages for one business process: "order 1 is open until paid or until it times out." Domain has identity and `MarkCompleted`. Application/Sagas loads by id, runs `Start` / `Handle` / `NotFound`. Persistence will store the durable row.

Without a saga you could still cascade `ChargePayment`, but you would have nowhere honest to put "this order is still waiting."

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why does NotFound exist? Isn't that just an error?</summary>

After payment, `MarkCompleted()` finishes the saga. The timeout scheduled at start is **not cancelled**. A minute later it still arrives.

If there is no `NotFound(OrderTimeout)`, "saga 1 is gone" is a failure. `NotFound` means "this message is harmless because the other path already finished." Same for `PaymentCharged` if the timeout already won.

That is normal in EDA: you design for messages that show up late, twice, or after the process is over. Prove-with: after complete, timeout hits `NotFound` instead of failing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why does Saga have no Id? Why is MarkCompleted only a flag?</summary>

`OrderSaga` declares `public int? Id { get; set; }`. Other sagas use `Guid` or `string`. An `Id` on the Hansom base would force one CLR type on every saga.

`MarkCompleted()` sets `IsCompleted`. It does not delete a Marten document. Application/Sagas treats the flag as "this instance is finished" (later Handle messages are a unified miss). Persistence owns the durable row. Domain/Sagas is data.

</details>

## Architecture

<details>
<summary>How does this sit with clean architecture (onion) and DDD?</summary>

Inner layers do not depend on outer ones. Domain does not know HTTP or Postgres. Application orchestrates. Infrastructure implements ports. Adapters (`Hansom.Postgresql`, `.RabbitMQ`, `.Http`) are separate projects so core cannot take those package references.

- **Messages** are the language of the domain. They are not a controller DTO and not a SQL row.
- **Handlers / saga methods** are use cases. `OrderSaga.Start` must not new up `ChargePaymentHandler`.
- **Helpdesk.Host** is the composition root. Helpdesk.Domain must not reference Hansom.

A **saga is a process manager**, not an aggregate. Hansom's `Saga` does not enforce "an order's line items." It tracks "this instance is open until something calls `MarkCompleted`." The timeout is a message in time, not a `DateTime` field you poll.

This repo is not a full domain model with repositories. The lesson is the messaging shape that DDD + onion usually want, plus a bus you own one folder at a time.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a *Plan class? Why empty sealed types with comments?</summary>

Each feature folder's `*Plan` is the spec for a slice that may not have runtime types yet: **Put here**, **Do not put here**, **Prove with**. Domain, Discovery, Bus, Mediator, Cascades, Execution, Middleware, and Scheduling used to be Plan-only; they now have real types. The remaining Plans (Logging, Validation, Outbox) describe the next slices.

The empty `sealed class` exists so the folder is a compilable C# project, not a markdown wiki. Implement against the comments. Do not invent a different split.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why no source generation?</summary>

Wolverine's biggest lever is its source generator — it emits handler code at compile time. Hansom uses runtime reflection via `HandlerConvention` instead. Cost: a slightly slower cold start. Benefit: no `InternalsVisibleTo` magic, no generator to learn, the catalog is debuggable in normal C#, and there is one less moving part in `dotnet build`.

If Hansom ever needs the cold-start win, the catalog can be cached to disk and read at startup — without changing the public shape.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How is the slice history kept honest?</summary>

The codemap (`codemap.md`, regenerable) records every landed slice with one line of context. Twenty-six slices have landed so far. The slice is the unit of progress, not the commit. Each slice ships with prove-with tests first; the production types follow.

Per project rules: branch from `origin/main`, PR to `main`, never a stacked PR. The codemap is updated in the slice commit, not in a follow-up.

</details>

## Adding a feature

<details>
<summary>How do I add a feature to Hansom?</summary>

1. Open (or write) the `*Plan` for the feature folder. Update **Put here** / **Do not put here** / **Prove with** if the spec has changed.
2. Write the prove-with test first. A failing xUnit fact in `tests/Hansom.Tests/<Folder>/`, snake_case name that describes behaviour, small fakes.
3. Implement the smallest type that makes the test pass. Onion rules: Domain does not import Application; Application does not import Infrastructure; `src/Hansom` does not ProjectReference any adapter.
4. Update the codemap with the new slice.
5. Branch from `origin/main`, PR to `main`. No stacked PRs.

If the feature crosses an adapter boundary (Postgres, Rabbit, HTTP), the new code goes in the adapter project, not the kernel.
