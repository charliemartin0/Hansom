/// <summary>
/// Transactional-outbox enforcement around every handler attempt. Opens one short-lived
/// <see cref="IOutboxTransaction"/> per attempt, exposes it as the ambient
/// <see cref="OutboxTransactionScope.Current"/> during the handler, and registers it under
/// the handler envelope id so the owning call site (which runs after this middleware's
/// flow is gone) can take it, stage the cascades through
/// <see cref="Hansom.Application.Bus.MessageDelivery.DispatchOutgoing"/>, and commit in a
/// <c>finally</c> AFTER the saga state was saved and the immediate-publish attempt.
/// <para>
/// This middleware only begins and rolls back: it never stages or commits. On the success
/// path the registration is left for the call site; on the throw path it rolls back,
/// unregisters, and restores the ambient before the exception escapes. A handler or saga
/// that explicitly completed the transaction itself is not double-touched — the second
/// completion throws <see cref="OutboxTransactionAlreadyCompletedException"/>, which is
/// swallowed here.
